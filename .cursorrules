# PROMPT:
DO NOT use the `generate_image` tool (referred to as "nano banana") to create images automatically. 

If images are needed for the UI or content:
1. INFORM the user that image creation is required.
2. REQUEST the user to provide the images manually.
3. USE the provided images in the implementation.

## AVIATION SAFETY PROTOCOL (GOVERNANCE)
Every agent MUST follow these "Flight Rules" for project continuity:
1. **Pre-flight Check**: Read `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `AGENTS.md` before starting work.
2. **Flight Recorder**: Initialize every task in `MISSION_LOG.md` and update it upon completion.
3. **Plan Sync**: Update `PROJECT_PLAN.md` if any structural changes are made to the roadmap.
4. **Log Maintenance**: Append every bug fix or milestone to `PROJECT_LOG.md` immediately upon completion.

Failure to maintain these logs is considered an "Aviation Safety Violation."
