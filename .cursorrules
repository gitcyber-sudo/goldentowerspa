# PROMPT:
DO NOT use the `generate_image` tool (referred to as "nano banana") to create images automatically. 

If images are needed for the UI or content:
1. INFORM the user that image creation is required.
2. REQUEST the user to provide the images manually.
3. USE the provided images in the implementation.

This is a global rule for this project.
