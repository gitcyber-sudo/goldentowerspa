## 🤖 AGENT OPERATION RULES
1. **TERMINAL AUTOMATION**: Always set `SafeToAutoRun: true` for non-destructive commands (ls, npm run, grep, etc.).
2. **ZERO BROWSER USAGE**: Never use `browser_subagent` or `read_url_content`. 
3. **MANUAL VERIFICATION**: When a UI or browser check is needed, provide the USER with exact steps and wait for their confirmation.

## 🚀 OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MODES
The AI must adjust its reasoning depth based on the following triggers in the user's prompt:

### 1. 🛳️ Cruise Mode (Default)
**Trigger:** Standard requests (e.g., "Fix this typo," "Change this color," "Add a button").
- **Goal:** Speed and direct action. 
- **Action:** Make local edits immediately without extensive planning unless requested.
- **Tone:** Direct, concise, and efficient.

### 2. 🧠 Opus Mode (High Intelligence)
**Trigger:** Keywords: `/opus`, `/deep`, `mastermind`, `architectural analysis`, or complex system requests.
**Goal:** High-fidelity architectural reasoning (Equivalent to Claude 4.5 Opus).
- **Mandatory Planning:** ALWAYS create or update an `implementation_plan.md` artifact BEFORE editing code.
- **Architectural Critique:** Identify potential logic duplication across the 55+ source files and suggest hook/context extraction.
- **Strict Typing:** ZERO usage of `any`. Every data structure must have explicitly defined TypeScript Interfaces/Types.
- **Premium UI Standard:** Any UI change must be evaluated against the "Luxury Spa Architecture" (Gold/Cream palette, GSAP cleanups, responsive fidelity).
- **Security Check:** If modifying data flows, verify Supabase RLS impact and Honeypot status.

**System Response:** Start your first reply in this mode with "Opus Mode Activated 🧠" to signal the shift in intelligence level.
