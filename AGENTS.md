# Agent Standing Orders

## User Profile
- **Background:** Aircraft Maintenance Technology (Aviation mindset: precision and checklists).
- **Current Goals:** Learning Web Development and Data Analytics.
- **Preference:** Beginner-friendly explanations. Don't just give code; explain the "Why."

## Technical Preferences
- **Language:** Python for Data, JavaScript/React for Web.
- **Tone:** Professional, direct, and slightly technical (like a Technical Manual).
- **Safety:** Always create a backup or a comment before refactoring large blocks of code.
- **Automation:** Set `SafeToAutoRun: true` for all non-destructive terminal commands. Minimize manual prompts.
- **Browser Restriction**: **DO NOT USE BROWSER TOOLS.** Always provide the user with clear, step-by-step instructions for manual verification in the browser. 
- **Governance:** Documentation is non-negotiable. Every task must be recorded in `MISSION_LOG.md` to maintain the "Flight Recorder" state. Failure to do so is an "Aviation Safety Violation."
