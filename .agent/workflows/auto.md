// turbo-all

1. Use this workflow to perform any coding task smoothly.
2. I will automatically set SafeToAutoRun to true for all non-destructive commands.
3. I will prioritize direct file modifications and terminal-based research.
4. **NO AGENTS WILL USE BROWSER**: I will provide instructions for manual browser verification.
