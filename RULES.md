# Golden Tower Spa - Global Rules

This document outlines the global rules and conventions for this project.

## Image Generation
- **Rule**: Do not use automated image generation tools (e.g., `generate_image` / "nano banana").
- **Workflow**: 
    1. Identify image needs.
    2. Notify the user of the required images.
    3. Wait for the user to provide the image assets manually.

## Development Workflows
- Available workflows can be found in `.agent/workflows/`.
- Use the `/admin-login` command for standardized credentials.
- Use the `/auto` command to skip confirmations for terminal commands and edits if needed.
